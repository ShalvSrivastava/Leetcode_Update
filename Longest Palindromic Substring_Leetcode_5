#explanation

This code defines a function called `longestPalindrome` that finds and returns the 
longest palindromic substring within a given string `s`. It initializes variables to
keep track of the longest palindrome found so far and uses dynamic programming to efficiently
identify palindromes of different lengths within `s`. By iterating through the string and updating 
the dynamic programming matrix, it identifies the longest palindromic substring and returns it.
